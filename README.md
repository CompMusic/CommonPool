CommonPool
==========

A Common pool of files that is not code that we need to share, contribute and improve publicly. This is primarily to share files that keep changing and get better (and hence need to be tracked) and need to be shared, but we have no obvious way to do that. Large bibtex files are a good example. 

To start with, I have added a few glossaries for Carnatic, Hindustani, Turkish music and Beijing Opera. These latex glassaries are perhaps the best way to write properly transliterated papers in latex. See the readme in the folder glassaries for more details.
