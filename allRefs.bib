  Abstract                 = {Each music tradition has its own characteristics in terms of melodic, rhythmic and timbral properties as well as semantic understandings. To analyse, discover and explore these culture-specific characteristics, we need music collections which are representative of the studied aspects of the music tradition. For Turkish makam music, there are various resources available such as audio recordings, music scores, lyrics and editorial metadata. However, most of these resources are not typically suited for computational analysis, are hard to access, do not have sufficient quality or do not include adequate descriptive information. In this paper we present a corpus of Turkish makam music created within the scope of the CompMusic project. The corpus is intended for computational research and the primary considerations during the creation of the corpus reflect some criteria, namely, purpose, coverage, completeness, quality and re-usability. So far, we have gathered approximately 6000 audio recordings, 2200 music scores with lyrics and 27000 instances of editorial metadata related to Turkish makam music. The metadata include information about makams, recordings, scores, compositions, artists etc. as well as the interrelations between them. In this paper, we also present several test datasets of Turkish makam music. Test datasets contain manual annotations by experts and they provide ground truth for specific computational tasks to test, calibrate and improve the research tools. We hope that this research corpus and the test datasets will facilitate academic studies in several fields such as music information retrieval and computational musicology.},

The mode and tonic information of the audio recordings is essential for many music information retrieval tasks such as automatic transcription, tuning analysis and music similarity and automatic description of digital music libraries applied to these cultures. In this paper we present MORTY, an open source toolbox for mode recognition and tonic identification. The toolbox implements a generalized variant of two state-of-the-art methods based on pitch distribution analysis. The algorithms are designed in a generic manner such that they can be easily optimized according to the culture-specific aspects of the studied music tradition. We test the generalized methodology systematically on the largest mode recognition dataset curated for Ottoman-Turkish makam music so far, which is composed of 1000 recordings in 50 modes. We obtained 95.8\%, 71.8\% and 63.6\% accuracy in tonic identification, mode recognition and joint estimation of the mode and tonic tasks, respectively. We additionally present recent experiments on Carnatic and Hindustani music in comparison with several methodologies recently proposed for raga/raag recognition. We believe that our toolbox would be used as a benchmark for future methodologies proposed for mode recognition and tonic identification, especially for music traditions in which these computational tasks have not been addressed yet.},

Computational descriptions abstracting the pitch content in audio music recordings have used this model, with reasonable success in several information retrieval tasks. In this paper, we argue that this model restricts a deeper understanding of the pitch content. First, we discuss a statistical model of musical notes which widens the scope of the current one and opens up possibilities to create new ways to describe the pitch content. Then we present a computational approach that partially aligns the audio recording with its music score in a hierarchical manner first at metrical cycle-level and then at note-level, to describe the pitch content using this model. It is evaluated extrinsically in a classification test using a public dataset and the result is shown to be significantly better compared to a state-of-the-art approach. Further, similar results obtained on a more challenging dataset which we have put together, reinforces that our approach outperforms the other.},

We present a composition identification methodology for these two tasks, which makes use of music scores. Our methodology first attempts to align a fragment of the music score of a composition with an audio recording. Next, it computes a similarity from the best obtained alignment. True audio-score pair emits a high similarity value. We repeat this procedure between all audio recordings and music scores, and filter the true pairs by a simple approach using logistic regression. The methodology is specialized according to the cultural-specific aspects of Ottoman-Turkish makam music (OTMM), achieving 0.96 and 0.95 mean average precision (MAP) for composition retrieval and performance retrieval tasks, respectively. We hope that our method would be useful in creating semantically linked music corpora for cultural heritage and preservation, semantic web applications and musicological studies.},

In this paper, we present a audio-score alignment methodology for the classical Ottoman-{T}urkish music tradition. Given a music score of a composition with structure (section) information and an audio performance of the same composition, our method first extracts a synthetic prominent pitch per section from the note values and durations in the score and a audio prominent pitch from the audio recording. Then it identifies the performed tonic frequency by using melodic information in the repetitive section in the score. Next it links each section with the time intervals where each section performed in the audio recording (i.e. structure level alignment) by comparing the extracted pitch features. Finally the score and the audio recordings are aligned in the note-level. For the initial experiments we chose DTW, a standard technique used in audio-score alignment, to show how well the state-of-the-art performs in makam musics. The results show that our method is able to handle the tonic transpositions and the structural differences with ease, however improvements, which address the characteristics of the music scores and the performances of makam musics, are needed in our note-level alignment methodology. To the best knowledge this paper presents the first audio-score alignment method proposed for makam musics.},

To this end we model the duration of phonemes specific for the case of singing. We rely on a duration-explicit hidden Markov model (DHMM) phonetic recognizer based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are extracted in a way robust to background instrumental sounds. The proposed approach is tested on polyphonic audio from the classical Turkish music tradition in two settings: with and without modeling phoneme durations. Phoneme durations are inferred from sheet music. In order to assess the impact of the polyphonic setting, alignment is evaluated as well on an acapella dataset, compiled especially for this study. We show that the explicit modeling of phoneme durations improves alignment accuracy by absolute 10 percent on the level of lyrics lines (phrases) and performs on par with state-of-the-art aligners for other languages.},

The karar frequency, hence the concert pitch varies among performances due to the existence of many diapasons in {T}urkish makam music, instead of a single standard one. Correct estimation of the karar frequency is critical for many computational tasks such as tuning analysis, audio-score alignment and automatic transcription. We present a new karar frequency identification method that is based on detecting the last note in the recording and estimating its frequency. The method is applied on two large datasets of {T}urkish makam music recordings and shown to outperform the state-of-the-art.},

A phonetic recognizer is employed, whereby each phoneme is assigned a hidden Markov model (HMM). Initially trained on speech, the models are adapted on singing voice to match the acoustic characteristics of the test dataset. Being the first study on lyrics-to-audio alignment applied on Turkish music, it could serve as a baseline for singing material with similar musical characteristics. As part of this work a dataset of recordings from the classical music tradition is compiled. Experiments, conducted separately for male and female singers, show that female singing is aligned more accurately.},

  Abstract                 = {Perceptual attack time (PAT) is defined as the time a tone's moment of attack or most salient metrical feature is perceived relative to its physical onset. Experiments are described that measured the PATs of recorded orchestral instrument tones by means of an interactive procedure with a computer and digital music synthesizer. Some PAT prediction models were then developed and tested against the empirical data. The most successful model had a correlation of 0.995 between measured and predicted PATs. The PAT is dependent on both rise time and listening level, indicating that the slope of the rise function is a key factor. Duration and spectrum can also act as cues to PAT, but are much less influential than amplitude or intensity cues. Possible relations to findings in physiology, particularly to the phenomenon of short√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩterm adaptation in the firing of auditory fibers, are discussed},

  Abstract                 = {Section linking aims at relating structural units in the notation of a piece of music to their occurrences in a performance of the piece. In this paper, we address this task by presenting a score-informed hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) for modeling musical audio signals on the temporal level of sections present in a composition, where the main idea is to explicitly model the long range and hierarchical structure of music signals. So far, approaches based on HHMM or similar methods were mainly developed for a note-to-note alignment, i.e. an alignment based on shorter temporal units than sections. Such approaches, however, are conceptually problematic when the performances differ substantially from the reference score due to interpretation and improvisation, a very common phenomenon, for instance, in {T}urkish makam music. In addition to having low computational complexity compared to note-to-note alignment and achieving a transparent and elegant model, the experimental results show that our method outperforms a previously presented approach on a {T}urkish makam music corpus.},

@phdthesis{niedermayer2012theory,
abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to introduce enhancements to existing Audio-to-Score Alignment systems which allow for a semi-automatic annotation of note onsets within audio recordings of different performances of classical piano pieces. The main focus is put on minimizing the number of note onsets a human annotator would need to correct. If an arbitrary number of notes is notated concurrently, it is treated as one single event by current state-of-the-art systems. Consequently, such a set of notes is assigned a common onset time. As one of the main contributions of this thesis, refinement strategies which resolve this simplification are proposed. This important step allows for dealing with stylistic details such as arpeggiations and asynchronies. For the accurate extraction of an individual notes onset, a feature is introduced that represents the activation energy of a single pitch. It relies on a model-based factorization of the spectrogram and can, in contrast to filter based approaches, be tuned to the musical context of a note. Based upon these techniques, a number of applications in the domain of computational musicology are discussed. Here, a prerequisite is an annotation tool, where the user can inspect and correct the automatically computed alignments. Accurate performance transcriptions can, then, be used for visualization of performer specific characteristics or the generation of respective performance models. The evaluation of the proposed methods is performed on a corpus of classical piano music comprising more than 100,000 notes and a performance time of about four hours. An exact ground truth annotation corresponding to the audio recordings was obtained by using a computer controlled grand piano. This allows us to measure the deviation between the actual and the automatically extracted onset times. Within the scope of this thesis, a system was developed for which the median of these time deviations is below 10 milliseconds over the entire evaluation corpus.},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic r{\={a}}ga recognition is one of the fundamental computational tasks in Indian art music. Motivated by the way seasoned listeners identify r{\={a}}gas, we propose a r{\={a}}ga recognition approach based on melodic phrases. Firstly, we extract melodic patterns from a collection of audio recordings in an unsupervised way. Next, we group similar patterns by exploiting complex networks concepts and techniques. Drawing an analogy to topic modeling in text classification, we then represent audio recordings using a vector space model. Finally, we employ a number of classification strategies to build a predictive model for r{\={a}}ga recognition. To evaluate our approach, we compile a music collection of over 124 hours, comprising 480 recordings and 40 r{\={a}}gas. We obtain 70\% accuracy with the full 40-r{\={a}}ga collection, and up to 92\% accuracy with its 10-r{\={a}}ga subset. We show that phrase-based r{\={a}}ga recognition is a successful strategy, on par with the state of the art, and sometimes outperforms it. A by-product of our approach, which arguably is as important as the task of r{\={a}}ga recognition, is the identification of r{\={a}}ga-phrases. These phrases can be used as a dictionary of semantically-meaningful melodic units for several computational tasks in Indian art music.},

most music recommendation systems are still quite generic and without much musical knowledge. In this paper we
present a web-based software application that lets users interact with an audio music collection through the use of
musical concepts that are derived from a specific musical culture, in this case Carnatic music. The application includes a database containing information relevant to that music collection, such as audio recordings, editorial information, and metadata obtained from various sources. An analysis module extracts features from the audio recordings that are related to Carnatic music, which are then used to create musically meaningful relationships between all
of the items in the database. The application displays the content of these items, allowing users to navigate through
the collection by identifying and showing other information that is related to the currently viewed item, either by
showing the relationships between them or by using culturally relevant similarity measures. The basic architecture
and the design principles developed are reusable for other music collections with different characteristics.},

to store the computational analysis of large databases of music-related

extraction algorithms to compute new data based on these input documents. The
feature extraction process can be distributed over many networked computers to
reduce calculation time. Researchers can develop and run their own algorithms on
a collection of music-related documents using any programming system
without needing system administrator knowledge or direct access to the
files, using a web based interface. Computed features are stored in the system
along with a reference to the version of the code that was used to compute it.
Audio files and computed features can be accessed over the internet.
This system has been developed as a supporting
part of the CompMusic project, allowing collaborating researchers to develop new
feature extraction algorithms and share them with other researchers. It has been
released under an open-source licence.},

  Abstract                 = {Tonic is a fundamental concept in many music traditions and its automatic identification should be relevant for establishing the reference pitch when we analyse the melodic content of the music. In this paper, we present two methodologies for the identification of the tonic in audio recordings of makam music of Turkey, both taking advantage of some score information. First, we compute a prominent pitch and a audio kernel-density pitch class distribution (KPCD) from the audio recording. The peaks in the KPCD are selected as tonic candidates. The first method computes a score KPCD from the monophonic melody extracted from the score. Then, the audio KPCD is circular-shifted with respect to each tonic candidate and compared with the score KPCD. The best matching shift indicates the estimated tonic. The second method extracts the mono- phonic melody of the most repetitive section of the score. Normalising the audio prominent pitch with respect to each tonic candidate, the method attempts to link the repetitive structural element given in the score with the respective time-intervals in the audio recording. The result producing the most confident links marks the estimated tonic. We have tested the methods on a dataset of makam music of Turkey, achieving a very high accuracy (94.9\%) with the first method, and almost perfect identification (99.6\%) with the second method. We conclude that score informed tonic identification can be a useful first step in the computational analysis (e.g. expressive analysis, intonation analysis, audio-score alignment) of music collections involving melody-dominant content.},

  Abstract                 = {R{\={a}}ga is the melodic framework of Indian art music. It is a core concept used in composition, performance, organization, and pedagogy. Automatic r{\={a}}ga recognition is thus a fundamental information retrieval task in Indian art music. In this paper, we propose the time-delayed melody surface (TDMS), a novel feature based on delay coordinates that captures the melodic outline of a r{\={a}}ga. A TDMS describes both the tonal and the temporal characteristics of a melody, using only an estimation of the predominant pitch. Considering a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier, TDMSs outperform the state-of-the-art for r{\={a}}ga recognition by a large margin. We obtain 98\% accuracy on a Hindustani music dataset of 300 recordings and 30 r{\={a}}gas, and 87\% accuracy on a Carnatic music dataset of 480 recordings and 40 r{\={a}}gas. TDMSs are simple to implement, fast to compute, and have a musically meaningful interpretation. Since the concepts and formulation behind the TDMS are generic and widely applicable, we envision its usage in other music traditions beyond Indian art music.},

All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel approach for onset detection of musical notes from audio signals is presented. In contrast to most commonly used conventional approaches, the proposed method features new detection functions constructed from the linear temporal bases that are obtained from the decomposition of musical spectra using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Three forms of detection function, namely, first-order difference function, psychoacoustically motivated relative difference function, and constant-balanced relative difference function, are considered. As the approach works directly on input data, no prior knowledge or statistical information is therefore required. Practical issues, including the choice of the factorization rank and detection robustness to instruments, are also examined experimentally. Due to the scalability issue with the generated nonnegative matrix, the proposed method is only applied to relatively short, single instrument (or voice) recordings. Numerical examples are provided to show the good performance of the proposed method, including comparisons between the three detection functions.},

Our previous efforts were directed towards developing technology for computational analysis of Turkish makam music which shares many common features with other maqam/makam traditions such as Arabic and Persian traditional music. This study presents an interactive tuning analysis tool developed with sufficient flexibility for parameter settings. We demonstrate that the tool can be effectively used for tuning analysis of Turkish music, Arabic music and Persian music once the appropriate settings are supplied by the user, using the interface of the tool.},
