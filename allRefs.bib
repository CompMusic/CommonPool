	abstract = {Karar is the final tone in the {T}urkish makam music performances. The karar frequency, hence the concert pitch varies among performances due to the existence of many diapasons in {T}urkish makam music, instead of a single standard one. Correct estimation of the karar frequency is critical for many computational tasks such as tuning analysis, audio-score alignment and automatic transcription. We present a new karar frequency identification method that is based on detecting the last note in the recording and estimating its frequency. The method is applied on two large datasets of {T}urkish makam music recordings and shown to outperform the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {For {T}urkish makam music, there exist several analysis tools which generally use only the audio as the input to extract the features of the audio. This study aims at extending such approach by using additional features such as scores, editorial metadata and the knowledge about the music. In this paper, the existing algorithms for similar research, the improvements we apply to the existing audio feature extraction tools and some potential topics for audio feature extraction of {T}urkish makam music are explained. For the improvements, we make use of the {T}urkish makam music corpus and the culture specific knowledge. We also present a web-based platform, Dunya, where the output of our research, such as pitch histograms, melodic progressions and segmentation information will be used to explore a collection of audio recordings of {T}urkish makam music.},

	abstract = {Section linking aims at relating structural units in the notation of a piece of music to their occurrences in a performance of the piece. In this paper, we address this task by presenting a score-informed hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) for modeling musical audio signals on the temporal level of sections present in a composition, where the main idea is to explicitly model the long range and hierarchical structure of music signals. So far, approaches based on HHMM or similar methods were mainly developed for a note-to-note alignment, i.e. an alignment based on shorter temporal units than sections. Such approaches, however, are conceptually problematic when the performances differ substantially from the reference score due to interpretation and improvisation, a very common phenomenon, for instance, in {T}urkish makam music. In addition to having low computational complexity compared to note-to-note alignment and achieving a transparent and elegant model, the experimental results show that our method outperforms a previously presented approach on a {T}urkish makam music corpus.},

@article{senturk2014sectionLinking,
abstract = {The most relevant representations of music are notations and audio recordings, each of which emphasizes a particular perspective and promotes different approximations in the analysis and understanding of music. Linking these two representations and analyzing them jointly should help to better study many musical facets by being able to combine complementary analysis methodologies. In order to develop accurate linking methods, we have to take into account the specificities of a given type of music. In this paper, we present a method for linking musically relevant sections in a score of a piece from makam music of Turkey (MMT) to the corresponding time intervals of an audio recording of the same piece. The method starts by extracting relevant features from the score and from the audio recording. The features of a given score section are compared with the features of the audio recording to find the candidate links in the audio for that score section. Next, using the sequential section information stored in the score, it selects the most likely links. The method is tested on a dataset consisting of instrumental and vocal compositions of MMT, achieving 92.1\% and 96.9\% F1-scores on the instrumental and vocal pieces, respectively. Our results show the importance of culture-specific and knowledge-based approaches in music information processing.},

@inproceedings{senturk2013tonic,
abstract = {Tonic is a fundamental concept in many music traditions and its automatic identification should be relevant for establishing the reference pitch when we analyse the melodic content of the music. In this paper, we present two methodologies for the identification of the tonic in audio recordings of makam music of Turkey, both taking advantage of some score information. First, we compute a prominent pitch and a audio kernel-density pitch class distribution (KPCD) from the audio recording. The peaks in the KPCD are selected as tonic candidates. The first method computes a score KPCD from the monophonic melody extracted from the score. Then, the audio KPCD is circular-shifted with respect to each tonic candidate and compared with the score KPCD. The best matching shift indicates the estimated tonic. The second method extracts the mono- phonic melody of the most repetitive section of the score. Normalising the audio prominent pitch with respect to each tonic candidate, the method attempts to link the repetitive structural element given in the score with the respective time-intervals in the audio recording. The result producing the most confident links marks the estimated tonic. We have tested the methods on a dataset of makam music of Turkey, achieving a very high accuracy (94.9\%) with the first method, and almost perfect identification (99.6\%) with the second method. We conclude that score informed tonic identification can be a useful first step in the computational analysis (e.g. expressive analysis, intonation analysis, audio-score alignment) of music collections involving melody-dominant content.},

@inproceedings{senturk2014alignment_fma,
abstract = {Audio-score alignment is a multi-modal task, which facilitates many related tasks such as intonation analysis, structure analysis and automatic accompaniment. In this paper, we present a audio-score alignment methodology for the classical Ottoman-{T}urkish music tradition. Given a music score of a composition with structure (section) information and an audio performance of the same composition, our method first extracts a synthetic prominent pitch per section from the note values and durations in the score and a audio prominent pitch from the audio recording. Then it identifies the performed tonic frequency by using melodic information in the repetitive section in the score. Next it links each section with the time intervals where each section performed in the audio recording (i.e. structure level alignment) by comparing the extracted pitch features. Finally the score and the audio recordings are aligned in the note-level. For the initial experiments we chose DTW, a standard technique used in audio-score alignment, to show how well the state-of-the-art performs in makam musics. The results show that our method is able to handle the tonic transpositions and the structural differences with ease, however improvements, which address the characteristics of the music scores and the performances of makam musics, are needed in our note-level alignment methodology. To the best knowledge this paper presents the first audio-score alignment method proposed for makam musics.},

All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments."

abstract = {Each music tradition has its own characteristics in terms of melodic, rhythmic and timbral properties as well as semantic understandings. To analyse, discover and explore these culture-specific characteristics, we need music collections which are representative of the studied aspects of the music tradition. For {T}urkish makam music, there are various resources available such as audio recordings, music scores, lyrics and editorial metadata. However, most of these resources are not typically suited for computational analysis, are hard to access, do not have sufficient quality or do not include adequate descriptive information. In this paper we present a corpus of {T}urkish makam music created within the scope of the CompMusic project. The corpus is intended for computational research and the primary considerations during the creation of the corpus reflect some criteria, namely, purpose, coverage, completeness, quality and re-usability. So far, we have gathered approximately 6000 audio recordings, 2200 music scores with lyrics and 27000 instances of editorial metadata related to {T}urkish makam music. The metadata include information about makams, recordings, scores, compositions, artists etc. as well as the interrelations between them. In this paper, we also present several test datasets of {T}urkish makam music. Test datasets contain manual annotations by experts and they provide ground truth for specific computational tasks to test, calibrate and improve the research tools. We hope that this research corpus and the test datasets will facilitate academic studies in several fields such as music information retrieval and computational musicology.},

  Abstract                 = {For Turkish makam music, there exist several analysis tools which generally use only the audio as the input to extract the features of the audio. This study aims at extending such approach by using additional features such as scores, editorial metadata and the knowledge about the music. In this paper, the existing algorithms for similar research, the improvements we apply to the existing audio feature extraction tools and some potential topics for audio feature extraction of Turkish makam music are explained. For the improvements, we make use of the Turkish makam music corpus and the culture specific knowledge. We also present a web-based platform, Dunya, where the output of our research, such as pitch histograms, melodic progressions and segmentation information will be used to explore a collection of audio recordings of Turkish makam music.}

  Abstract                 = {Perceptual attack time (PAT) is defined as the time a tone's moment of attack or most salient metrical feature is perceived relative to its physical onset. Experiments are described that measured the PATs of recorded orchestral instrument tones by means of an interactive procedure with a computer and digital music synthesizer. Some PAT prediction models were then developed and tested against the empirical data. The most successful model had a correlation of 0.995 between measured and predicted PATs. The PAT is dependent on both rise time and listening level, indicating that the slope of the rise function is a key factor. Duration and spectrum can also act as cues to PAT, but are much less influential than amplitude or intensity cues. Possible relations to findings in physiology, particularly to the phenomenon of shortâ€�term adaptation in the firing of auditory fibers, are discussed},

  Abstract                 = {A novel approach for onset detection of musical notes from audio signals is presented. In contrast to most commonly used conventional approaches, the proposed method features new detection functions constructed from the linear temporal bases that are obtained from the decomposition of musical spectra using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Three forms of detection function, namely, first-order difference function, psychoacoustically motivated relative difference function, and constant-balanced relative difference function, are considered. As the approach works directly on input data, no prior knowledge or statistical information is therefore required. Practical issues, including the choice of the factorization rank and detection robustness to instruments, are also examined experimentally. Due to the scalability issue with the generated nonnegative matrix, the proposed method is only applied to relatively short, single instrument (or voice) recordings. Numerical examples are provided to show the good performance of the proposed method, including comparisons between the three detection functions.},
